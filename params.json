It returns an object literal. The get function\r\ntakes a callback as a parameter. You can use the callback to parse the returned beach\r\ndata when it has been retrieved.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar beaches = require('niagara-beaches');\r\nbeaches.get(function(err, data) {\r\n  if (err) {\r\n    return console.log(err);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  for (var i = 0, max = data.length; i < max; i++) {\r\n    console.log(data[i]);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n### Getting Started with the CLI\r\n\r\nInstall Niagara Beaches globally to use the command line interface.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnpm install niagara-beaches -g\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then run the command `niagara-beaches` from your command line to return the status\r\nreport for each beach in Niagara. The report includes the age of the data.\r\n\r\nAn example excerpt from running this command is: `Long Beach is closed due to E. Coli\r\n(21 hours ago).`\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nickolas Kenyeres\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
